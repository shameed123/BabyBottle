# BabyBottle
This script frees up storage space on OpenPilot when less than 10GB of space is remaining.

# Why do you need this script
When you go out on a long drive, with no access to Wifi, your drives will not be uploaded, thereby causing your used space to grow.  If this continues, it will end up in filling up your storage space (which is currently around 55GB on a 64GB EON).  This renders your OpenPilot unusable.
